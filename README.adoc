= Sudoku Solver

== Suboku

If you don't know what Sudoku is you can find a lot of good documentation on
internet. For example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku[here] on Wikipedia.

A simple grid would look like this:

The black numbers are the initial values.

The red numbers are the numbers that solve the puzzle.

== What is this?

This is a personal project to solve automatically Sudoku puzzles.

== How has it been built

=== The GRID

This program is built on a Grid (basically a 3 dimensions jagged array).

image::grid_and_layers.png[Grid and Layers]

Every *Value* (1, 2, 3 ...) has its own layer : the first dimension of the Grid.

Every *Cell* on the Grid is identified with its coordinates: `(x, y)`,
the last two dimensions of the grid.

image::grid_and_coordinates.png[Coordinates]

Every Cell is grouped by quadrant.

image::grid_quadrant.png[Quadrant]

These arrays *Values* are picked from the `CellStatus` enum.

Initially all the cells have the `CellStatus.EMPTY` value.

Every time a number is entered at coordinate `(x,y)`
the corresponding layer is updated with the *Value*
(`CellStatus.ONE`, `CellStatus.TWO`...).

Every other cells on the same line (same x coordinate),
same column (same y coordinate)
and same quadrant are set as `CellStatus.FORBIDDEN`.

image::grid_forbidden_and_occupied.png[Empty, Forbidden and Occupied]

Empty cells are in white, forbidden in red, occupied in blue.

An additional two dimensions array is maintained to memorize the original values.

This Grid ensure the integrity of the program.

=== The GUI

The application launch the `MainGui` that will in turn choose between EmptyGui and SolvedGui.

The `EmptyGui` is the one that allows the user to fill the grid with the initial values.

The `SolvedGui` is the one displaying the puzzle solution. The values in red are the initial ones.

Both classes extends the `AbstractGui` that comes with the routine who build the Quadrants
and the inner cells and the bottom toolbar with the exit button. Two methods are to be implemented
by the subclasses.

* The first one is used to fill the cells with:
** TextFiled for the `EmptyGui` class.
** colored value for the `SolvedGui` class.
* The second is used to add the action buttons:
** 'Solve' for the `EmptyGui` class.
** 'Reset' for the `SolvedGui` class.

=== The SOLVER ENGINE

The `GridSolverEngine` has a set of solvers, currently two. It runs the two solvers
against the Grid to try to solve it.

Every solver extends `GridSolver` which contains the routine that goes through every cells
and then call the subclass overloaded `findSolution` method. The solver stops either
when the Grid is solved or when the Solver went through the whole Grid without being
able to find any solutions.

==== OnlyPossibleValueGridSolver

This solver checks if there is only one possible Value for the current cell.
If true then it sets it.

==== OnlyPossibleValuePlaceGridSolver

This solver checks for every possible values in the current cell if one of these values
can't be place somewhere else on the same Row, same Column of same Quadrant. If so than
it will set the value.

== How to build it

Simple `mvn` command will do the trick

 mvn compile

== How to run it

Simple `mvn` command will do it here too

 mvn exec:java
